1 - Find a Bill

The first step is to find a Bill to push out to Sway users, to do this you can do one of two things:

A. Search around media sites in order to find a Bill, or
B. Check out Baltimore Legistar - https://baltimore.legistar.com/Legislation.aspx

Criteria + Notes:
- More recent Bills are preferred since they may be getting more coverage in the media and people want an outlet to express their opinion.
- Bills that are closer to a vote (3rd reading vs. 1st reading in Baltimore) are preferrable since a voting is what gives Sway its purpose.
    - There's a tension here between when the legislator votes and when Sway users vote:
    - Sway voting before legislator - the legislator may not vote on the legislation and there's no record for a user to compare themselves to.
    - Sway votes after the legislator - Sway users lose their chance to effect the legislation.
- A Bill that has more media coverage will be easier to cover in Sway.
- "Un-interesting" Bills where the whole legislator is in unanimous agreement are still valuable for their informational content.

2 - Fill in basic information

Once you've decided on a Bill to add to Sway, maybe the most difficult is finding the external Bill ID and (if available) the Bill Version. This is the ID assigned to the Bill by the legislator.

* If you found a Bill through Baltimore Legistar, the Bill ID is easy to find, it's the "File #".
* If you founda  Bill through a media site, they may not list the Bill ID, meaning you need to match the Bill from the media site to the Bill in Legistar - this can sometimes be tricky, but try narrowing it down by the date the media article was published.

Once you've identified the Bill in Legistar you can add:
* the Bill ID
* the Bill Version, if any
* the Title of the Bill, shortened to be readable by a human:
    - Example - The Bill - "Paraprofessional and School-Related Personnel Appreciation Week For the purpose of recognizing the week of October 3 through 7, 2022, and the first full calendar week of October annually thereafter, as Paraprofessional and School-Related Personnel (PSRP) Appreciation Week to celebrate the invaluable contributions of Baltimore Cityâ€™s Paraprofessionals and School-Related Personnel in educating and caring for our children."
    - Can be shortened to - "Paraprofessional and School-Related Personnel Appreciation Week".
* a Link to the Bill - example - https://baltimore.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=5862690&GUID=B1F0D43D-F951-427F-90F6-9FBC08A2C116
    - remove the "&Options=ID|Text|&Search=" stuff at the end.
* the main Sponsor of the Bill - i.e. the person who introduced the legislation.
    - Nominations for offices have a main sponsor/introducer of the Mayor.
* the current Chamber the Bill is in, if applicable.
* the Bill Status - for Baltimore Bill's that are on 1st, 2nd, or 3rd readings, use the status "in committee".
* the date of the last vote on the Bill, if any - choose the most recent vote if more than one, although make sure that the vote is on the Bill itself and NOT on an amendment to the Bill.
* the Supporters, Opposers and Abstainers of the Bill
    - if there has not yet been a vote on the legislation, you can list the main sponsor/introducer + any co-sponsors as Supporters.
    - Nominations for offices have a main sponsor/introducer of the Mayor.

3 - Add a Sway summary of the Bill

The summary should be as objective as possible and should generally be a synopsis of one or more media outlets. The main purpose of Sway is to be a platform for empowerment, NOT a media outlet. It's a tricky line to not cross but by synopsizing other media outlets hopefully this issue can be avoided as much as possible.
- Any sources used should include a link to the source at the bottom of the summary.
- Optionally a recording of someone describing the legislation can be added, for those who prefer to listen instead of read and for those who are visually impaired.

Valid Baltimore City media sites for Sway summaries (non-exhaustive + extensible):
* Baltimore Banner
* Baltimore Sun
* WYPR
* Baltimore Beat
* Baltimore Fishbowl
* Baltimore Brew
* The Afro
* Bloc by Block
* Washington Post
* Local CBS/ABC/NBC/Fox websites
* Others on approval.

Organizational For/Against opinions can come from any website.

3A - Markdown

Summaries support Markdown, a way to style text - https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/, some common uses are:

- italicize text by wrapping a word or words in single asterisks, example - \*hello\* = *hello* - https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/#italic

- bold text by wrapping a word or words in double asterisks, example - \*\*hello\*\* = **hello** - https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/#blockquotes-1

- quoting, to insert a "blockquote" use a > at the beginning of the text - https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/#blockquotes-1
\> Blockquote =
> Blockquote

- numbered or bulleted lists - https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/#lists-1

4 - Add organization positions

Organizations - private companies, non-profits, political parties and government agencies - often have opinions about legislation, these opinions can be be added to Sway as arguments "For" or "Against" the legislation.

Summaries of organization positions are meant to be subjective and should show a clear argument for or against the piece of legislation in question.

These positions should NOT be blatant lies and should include support for the claims they make. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion but not their own facts.

Like Sway summaries of a Bill these summaries:
- include support for Markdown, as outlined above.
- should include a link at the end to the media site that includes the opinion, if it is not an opinion sent to Sway directly.
- also support audio recordings.

TIP: You can often find subjective opinions on Baltimore Legistar as comments regarding the Bill.

5 - Submit

Once a new Bill is submitted through Sway it will be reviewed for grammar and spelling before being released to users.
