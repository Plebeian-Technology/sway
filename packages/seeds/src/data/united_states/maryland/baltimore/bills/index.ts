In addition, the bill prohibits any person in Baltimore City from obtaining, retaining, accessing, or using certain face surveillance technology or any information obtained from this technology.NEWLINEIn the past year, several municipalities have implemented some form of ban on surveillance technology, specifically facial recognition technology, including Minneapolis, San Francisco, Boston, and Oakland. Numerous studies have documented inaccuracies from facial recognition technology, particularly among certain groups such as women and people of color. Multiple cases of facial recognition misidentifications have led to wrongful police action, which have come to light in recent years. Additionally, surveillance technologies, including facial recognition, are often disproportionately deployed in Black and Brown communities.NEWLINEThis legislation cannot ban the Baltimore Police Department from using the technology, because the department is under the control of the state, not the city. BPD, along with the Department of Transportation, uses the Maryland Image Repository System (MIRS) as part of their investigation processes. MIRS, which is maintained by the Maryland Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services, is a facial recognition software that compares images of unidentified suspects to state and FBI mugshots, as well as motor vehicle records.ENDINGhttps://www.wypr.org/post/burnett-seeks-regulation-facial-recognition-technology-baltimore.",

One way this is achieved is by setting specific MBE/WBE participation goals for contracts. In addition, the Department of Finance’s Bureau of Procurement partners with MWBOO to support MBE/WBE vendors in understanding the City’s procurement process and referring vendors to MWBOO, as appropriate, to become certified MBE/WBE businesses with the City.NEWLINEIn 2018, former Mayor Catherine Pugh issued an executive order, 2018-02, which established the goal of increasing City contracts with lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) owned businesses.
