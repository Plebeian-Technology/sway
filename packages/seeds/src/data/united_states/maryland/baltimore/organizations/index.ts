This includes the heroizing, mythologizing, and white washing of some of history’s worst actors, from Columbus to the Confederacy, the continuation of which constitutes an act of propaganda.NEWLINEToday, monuments still stand as manifestations of these lies, even while the same system of white supremacy continues its reign of physical and systemic violence against Black and Brown people. This violence takes many forms including pervasive and appalling police violence.NEWLINEIn 2020 we face yet another moment of reckoningwith racism and white supremacy, which again has been sparked by an incident of police violence; five years after the killing of Freddie Gray; remembering the deaths of Korryn Gaines, Anton Black, Tyrone West, Dale Graham, and other Marylanders who were killed by police; acknowledging the difficult struggle faced bysurvivors of police violence like Keith Davis, Abdul Salaam, Jamar Kennedy; and in the aftermath of the murders of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery, Rayshard Brooks, and so many others nationwide.NEWLINEThis moment has brought many new people to join the police abolition movement, and it has moved governments and citizens all across the country to take down their monuments. Rather than continue to allow monuments to stand to murderers, brutalizers, and oppressors, we should honor the memories of victims who have lost their lives, and create space for those survivors who continue to persevere.NEWLINEAnd so a beacon will stand in tribute to those who are victims of police violence and brutality, and their families and friends who bear the weight of trauma, signifying for all to see that their lives and stories matter, and that our work will be to change the system that wronged them.ENDINGhttps://baltimore.legistar.com/View.ashx?M=F&ID=8830531&GUID=4BFC7CA6-A8BA-4C7C-9EFC-9F522645B812",
